[Verse: Gerard, Spoken]
Mejico!
How are you?!

Oh my god, it's been so long. We miss you guys so much. How have you been?
You look real good

So we'll have you guys know that tonight the reason that we're filming this, is because this is the last performance of The Black Parade... FOREVER!

And we wanted to come down here, to Mexico, to properly kill them off

This song, is all about dreams
It's called... "Disenchanted"

I got some things to do
But I don't want to do 'em
I got some things to say
I will never say 'em to your face

I lost my lungs
I don't really need 'em
I lost my heart
I don't really need it anymore

I am in love with somebody and guess what?
It's not you, it's not you
You are in love with somebody
Yeah, you love yourself so well, love yourself so well

Smokey hands and sweaty palms
Black water and half-clear lungs
And I know I'm not going home
Broken bottles and dirty dishes
Acid flashbacks in your kitchen
You know I'm not going home

I am in love with somebody and guess what?
It's not you, it's not you
You are in love with somebody
Yeah, you love yourself so well, love yourself so well

There's someone else
They love them well
Someone else
They love them

I got some things to do
But I don't want to do 'em
I got some things to say
I will never say 'em to your face

I got some things to do
But I don't want to do 'em
I got some things to say
I will never say 'em to your face, to your face

There's someone else
They love them well
This is someone else
They love them

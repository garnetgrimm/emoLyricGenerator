[verse]
yes i thought our mouths would meet
or at the very least our eyes
never even tried
ignoring every bit of light
that escaped our minds

[refrain]
as if we were asleep
as if we were asleep
as if we were asleep
as if we were

[bridge]
in the morning i'll be fine
in the morning i'll be fine
in the morning i'll be fine
in the morning i'll be fine
in the morning i'll be fine

[outro]
let me bathe amidst my ignorance ignorance
as if i were asleep
as if i were asleep

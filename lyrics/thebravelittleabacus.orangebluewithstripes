[verse]
i want it to be selfishly how i want it
one human read my cue cue tears
cue the followed dance around it
because then we can scream
i might as well just scream

[chorus]
hi emily you don't have to play
you are not her and he is not me
emily you don't have to play
you are not her and he is not me

[bridge]
what i said about christmas trees
made me believe there were two of me
and one of them would've said hannah
way before now
way before now
way before now
way before now
way before now
way before now
way before

[outro]
at some point it stops

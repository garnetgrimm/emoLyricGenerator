[verse 1]
placed behind door number 3
i lay shaking will he pick me
don't be alarmed or misinterpret
for it's his anonymity that put me here
i should decide whether it's
the dopamine or someone hitting refresh on my

[chorus 1]
spinal
chord is aching as if the earth
like me
been shaking shaken up

[verse 2]
door number 3 has opened up
and like that the world pounces on the knobs of one and two
if we can't have it all then why have anything at all
they chant
their song sending shivers up and down around my

[chorus 2]
spinal
chord is aching as if the earth
like me
been shaking shaken
up and
into the place we know will give the
verdict
then finding that there's something in the
something in the
something in the water

[verse 3]
but i can't seem to put my glass down
maybe because soon i'll be inside
drowning in it's confines
pounding on the glass like i were five

[verse 4]
i can't remember what it was i felt
or heard or saw or touched after hearing the word hello
dancing figures intimate i know
but there was more involved that made me believe
that there were two of them and only one of me

[verse 5]
it gets harder to see them as the water rises as i criticize it
it's his eye it
fills the glass it's all that i could ask
for he is drowning in the same room as me
and it's the very thing that makes me believe
that there are two of him and only one of me

[outro]
let me bathe amidst my ignorance ignorance
as if i were asleep
as if i were asleep

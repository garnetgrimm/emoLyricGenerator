[Verse 1]
I don't wanna fucking be here anymore
I'm leaving forever, if you miss me whatever, I don't care
I'm tired of your face
And the way that you hate everything

[Chorus 1]
You make me want to start smoking
Cigarettes so I die slowly
Anything that's bad for me
You're killing me
You're killing me

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna fucking hear it anymore
I know you got problems
And we've all got problems too
I'm sick of being your shoulders
You know I need shoulders too

[Chorus 2]
You make me want to start rolling
Fat ass blunts till I start choking
Anything that's bad for me
You're killing me
You're killing me

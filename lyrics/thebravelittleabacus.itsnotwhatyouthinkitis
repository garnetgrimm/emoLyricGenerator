[verse 1]
this is my resignation from the scene
hating mtv is getting old
i said no once got stabbed in the back
while they said relax
in sweden they got it right i guess
but where does that leave me leaving
always leaving never staying
good thing my feet are still intact
it's just my hands that are killing me
killing someone else may make for better poetry
at least that's what they said
but at this moment clarity's appeared
and i am gone off to what i've found more in
the fact i hate the way i talk
cynics mock all surroundings
i just wish to live with the ones that
instead of hating mtv
beat on the floorboards to wake their tenants
that they know are not asleep
the way we're sure they're not asleep
we woke up in the same bed

[verse 2]
this whole imaginary underground
has got me thinking got me dreaming
and if we're all our own copilots
in our cockpits made of tin
and then we fall down hills of pavement
it's time i grew and said to them
it's not what you think it is
we analyze the states we're in
why is it that when we sneeze
there's a chance we'll die
alone alone alone alone
alone alone
alone that's what i hope i'll want to be
when all acquaintance leaves me
because if i don't who knows i might just see
that no one needs me seeing

I forgot to take my meds today
I can't believe it's only Tuesday
Figures it hit me on the highway
I forgot to take my meds today

I know I can't do fun things after work
Because I'm too scared to smile and risk the effort
I'm sorry you don't feel loved right now
I'm having trouble pretending to be myself

I feel like I'm grounded in bubble gum when I try to move
I'm sinking in quick sand with one arm reaching out

I forgot to take my meds today
I can't believe it's only Tuesday
Figures it hit me on the highway
I forgot to take my meds today

I forgot to take my meds

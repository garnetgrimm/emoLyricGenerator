[verse 1]
just shut up and swallow before your last breath
you'll say what's to be said
well my last breath breathed leaked last night
as he melted into walls
that spoke like the sun to the last man and woman on the earth
we will both die nice and warm

[verse 2]
warm is what it is to see
his insides on the floor
of an abandoned auditorium
singing in polyphony

[bridge]
just shut up and swallow is what the kid meant
when he complained about all of it
the ease of an important procedure and how everyone everywhere was always mostly often laying down on him maiming crushing killing him
but i bought none of it this is not universal
kid is not he who abandoned that auditorium and no i do not want to become him anymore but yes i do want him to become what i believe he once was my best friend and stop that he still is
i don't really think about it that way no i don't really ever think about it that way

is your brain big enough to get your feelings hurt me neither

well me neither

[verse 3]
i think i'll leave this place now
go to summer where the sun won't go down
i'll gladly leave this place now
wonderful the days would seem away from here

you hate everyone; to you everyone's either a moron or a creep or a poser why do you suddenly care about their opinion of you
because i'm shallow okay i want them to like me

[outro]
just shut up and swallow i thought they all said
so i complained about all of it but now
i think i'll leave this place now
i think i'm the same
now we're the same

[verse gerard spoken]
mejico
how are you

oh my god it's been so long we miss you guys so much how have you been
you look real good

so we'll have you guys know that tonight the reason that we're filming this is because this is the last performance of the black parade forever

and we wanted to come down here to mexico to properly kill them off

this song is all about dreams
it's called disenchanted
